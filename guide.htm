	<h1>General Guidelines of Mountaineering</h1>
	<p class="warning">Mountaineering can be a challenging and rewarding activity, but it is important to follow
		guidelines to ensure your safety and the safety of others. Here are some general guidelines to follow while
		mountaineering:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Plan ahead:</strong> Before embarking on a mountaineering trip, it is important to plan ahead.
			Research the route and weather forecast, bring necessary equipment and clothing, and inform someone of your
			plans. It is also a good idea to bring a map and compass in case of emergencies.</li>
		<li><strong>Follow the rules:</strong> Respect the mountain and the environment by following local rules and
			guidelines. This includes staying on marked trails, not littering, and avoiding disturbing wildlife or
			damaging plants.</li>
		<li><strong>Be prepared:</strong> Make sure you are physically and mentally prepared for the challenges of
			mountaineering. This includes being in good physical shape, having the necessary climbing skills, and being
			aware of potential hazards. It is also important to be prepared for emergencies by bringing a first aid kit
			and knowing basic first aid techniques.</li>
		<li><strong>Climb with a partner:</strong> It is always safer to climb with a partner. This way, you can watch
			out for each other and provide assistance if necessary. If you do choose to climb solo, make sure to inform
			someone of your plans and check in regularly.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>By following these guidelines, you can have a safe and enjoyable mountaineering experience. Remember to always be
		prepared, respect the mountain and the environment, and stay safe.</p>
