    <h1>Hazards of Mountaineering</h1>
    <p class="warning">Mountaineering can be a dangerous activity. It is important to be aware of the potential hazards
        and take necessary precautions to ensure your safety.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Altitude sickness:</strong> This can occur when climbing to high altitudes, where the air is thinner
            and there is less oxygen. Symptoms include headache, nausea, and difficulty breathing. It can be serious and
            even deadly if not treated promptly.</li>

            important to use proper climbing techniques and equipment to prevent falls.</li>

        <li><strong>Avalanches:</strong> These can occur when snow and ice on a mountain slope become unstable and slide
            down. They can be triggered by a variety of factors including temperature, wind, and the weight of climbers.
            It is important to be aware of the conditions and take necessary precautions to avoid avalanches.</li>

            lightning, and snowstorms. It is important to be prepared for these conditions and seek shelter if
            necessary.</li>
